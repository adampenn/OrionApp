The lack of supplemental income results in several athletes not only focusing on their sport and schoolwork but a job as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">Athletes at Chico State are not given free housing, and most do not have their tuition paid for. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/college-football\/story\/_\/id\/13455477\/nlrb-says-northwestern-players-cannot-unionize\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lack of benefits<\/a> given to the athletes at Division II schools shows the ways that universities are able to make money on the talent of their players.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">It\u2019s not just a problem that affects the 300 athletes at Chico State, it\u2019s across the NCAA. The NCAA has no specific ruling against paying athletes but has been active in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2015\/05\/05\/ncaa-pay-players-student-athletes_n_7207860.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">advocating against the idea<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">The Division I schools under the NCAA are allowed to give their athletes full-ride scholarships but are not given other forms of income. The benefits <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncaa.org\/student-athletes\/future\/scholarships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">diminish<\/a> as athletes participate in lesser leagues, with Division II athletes only being offered a fraction of their tuition cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">The problem that the NCAA fails to address is that college athletes aren\u2019t a big ticket item for the league to exploit. The league made <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncaa.org\/about\/resources\/finances\/revenue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$6 billion<\/a> on their college athletes last year, despite the athletes being alone on the field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">College is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/college-sports\/story\/_\/id\/8236949\/ncaa-increases-minimum-eligibility-standards-division-student-athletes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">requirement for athletes<\/a> who are considering going pro, but rather than improve their skills on the field, and gain an education, athletes are forced to struggle through the experience to make it to next level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">The idea of college athletes enduring the four-year grind to reach the pros is not an acceptable standard anymore, with only about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncaa.org\/about\/resources\/research\/estimated-probability-competing-professional-athletics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">two percent<\/a> making it past the collegiate level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">The revenue the student-athletes are generating each game is not reflected by ramen noodle dinners and pint-sized dorms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">The NCAA has addressed the issue of paying their college athletes, as there is no standard rate across sports, or even among athletes. With football and basketball gaining more attention than golf, the NCAA has reported that it cannot give athletes the same salary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">While the athletes might contribute different amounts to their teams or draw different crowds, the same phenomenon happens in professional sports. Athletes are fairly paid for their efforts, despite varying in skill and performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">Allowing schools to pay their athletes does not take away from the integrity of the organization, but rather supplies athletes with a more achievable path to the professional league.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">With the NCAA making millions on its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncaa.org\/student-athletes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">460,000 athletes<\/a>, the players deserve more than stressful schedules and the possibility of career-ending injuries. Athletes should not be forced to endure more during their college experience in an endeavor to continue playing their sports.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s4\"><b>Kenta McAfee can be reached at<\/b><i> <\/i><\/span>sportseditor@theorion.com or @KentaMcAfee on Twitter.\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_59734\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"59734\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The only difference between college athletes and high school athletes is the workload.

He has a good chance to make it because of the work that he&#8217;s put in and his ability to feel comfortable and confident,&#8221; Towne said.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56690\" style=\"width: 396px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Medina1WEB.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-56690\"><img alt=\"Medina1WEB.jpg\" src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Medina1WEB-386x475.jpg\" data-uniq-id=\"0fbeb\" width=\"386\" height=\"475\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-56690\" srcset=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Medina1WEB-386x475.jpg 386w, http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Medina1WEB.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sophomore Kyle Medina watches his other teammates while warming up before practice. Photo credit: Cam Lesslie<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Despite breaking the school record and leading the NCAA Division II with his 1,500-meter time, Medina was only focused on gaining a qualifying time for the Olympic trials.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cool to have broken the record, but I&#8217;m not trying to make too much out of it. My goal is just to get a mark that will get me into the Olympic trials,&#8221; Medina said.<\/p>\n<p>Although Medina did not compete in the Wildcats&#8217; most recent event, he still has the CCAA championship race and the national race to reach his time. <\/p>\n<p>With the NCAA Division II championships on May 26 and the Olympic trials for track and field on July 1, Medina is racing against time. <\/p>\n<p>While the final date to qualify inches closer, Towne is unconcerned as he said he believes in Medina&#8217;s abilities as a runner.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He is a student of the sport. He&#8217;s a track junkie and he wants to be there. With his drive, he will make it,&#8221; Towne said. <\/p>\n<p><b>Kenta McAfee can be reached at <\/b>orionsportseditor@gmail.com or @KentaMcAfee on Twitter.<\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_56687\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"56687\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sophomore Kyle Medina set his sights on the Olympic trials after breaking school record.\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_56687\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"56687\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"author":3,"featured_media":56691,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"format":"standard","categories":[13,1956],"tags":[12663,6224,7235,12665,564,123,12664,12662],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/56687"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=56687"}],"version-history":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/56687\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/56691"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=56687"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=56687"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=56687"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
