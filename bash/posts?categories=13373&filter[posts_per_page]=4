He ended last season with 394 points and averaged 15.2 points per game. Duncan\u2019s leadership, as one of the more seasoned players, provides the team with a consistent shooter.<\/p>\n<p>Another returner is junior forward Isaiah Ellis, who was an important player in the post. Ellis scored 357 points last season and averaged 12.3 points per game. Ellis was also consistent on the glass with 147 rebounds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Both junior guards Corey Silverstrom and Jalen McFerren offer the team a multitude of scoring options, as each one scored over 280 points last season, and averaged nearly 10 points per game. Silverstrom is a consistent threat from three-point range, while McFerren offers the team a talented passer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>A major asset the team recently acquired is senior forward Michael Bethea Jr. who transferred to Chico State from Grambling State. The forward provides the team with Division I experience. He averaged five points per game before transferring.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">The team lost Tanner Giddings and center Christopher Magalotti, both who were talented rebounders. The addition of Bethea as a forward to support Ellis inside can prevent the team from losing valuable points in the paint.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">The team does not have an experienced center. Only first-year athletes Justin Briggs and Spencer LaShells are the team\u2019s available big men.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Briggs redshirted his last season and had time to learn from his teammates, but has yet to compete as a Wildcat during the season. Before coming to Chico State, Briggs was ranked 31st as a high school player in 2015 by NorCal Preps.<\/p>\n<p>LaShells has yet to experience playing on the court for Chico State, but was a star in high school. NorCal Preps ranked him 22nd as a player and No. 7 as a power forward and center.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Although the team does not have a veteran center to support it, consistent scoring options and the experience of the team gives it the ability to be a top competitor in its league this season.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Jordan Jarrell can be reached at<\/b> sportseditor@theorion.com or @ChicoOrionJJ on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_60162\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"60162\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Despite the lack of veteran players, the men\u2019s basketball team went 22-7 and made it to the California Collegiate Athletic Association Tournament and NCAA Tournament last season.

A lack of defense allowed other teams to snag an easy win against the Wildcats. Chico State sits third from the bottom of its conference with an opponent scoring average of 64.3 points per game.<\/p>\n<p>A -4.5 scoring margin and 36 percent team shooting average hindered the Wildcats throughout the season as they failed to score and contest their opponents shots.<\/p>\n<p>Although the team saw severe deficits in its scoring, the biggest detriment was the inability to score from behind the arc. Chico State made less than 30 percent of its three-point attempts, with junior guard Whitney Branham leading the team at 33 percent.<\/p>\n<p>An unreliable offensive effort to help the Wildcats claw their way back into the game and a struggling defense gave way to the team&#8217;s losing streaks.<\/p>\n<p>This season, the team will be playing without starting guard and forward Brooke Bowen. Bowen averaged 8.2 points per game and was a large contributor to the steal column with 1.5 per game.<\/p>\n<p>The team is retaining the remainder of its players, including Branham who led the team in scoring with both quality and quantity. Branham averaged 11.9 points per game and shot 89 percent from the charity stripe.<\/p>\n<p>The Wildcats also have their assist leader from last year, senior guard Sherise Porchia, to give them an offensive boost. Porchia was a CCAA leader in assists averaging 4 per game and 105 total.<\/p>\n<p>The returning players this season will be critical to the team&#8217;s success as they carry over the success in its individual play. The team also acquired three new players this season, two junior transfer athletes and two first-year players.<\/p>\n<p>Transfer junior forward Jo Paine and first-year forward Taki Brandon are unproven on the Wildcat roster but have several benefitting attributes to help the team. Paine transferred from Clackamas Community College where she earned the Southern Region MVP and was the lead scorer and rebounder for her team.<\/p>\n<p>Brandon has yet to play at the collegiate level but earned Honorable Mention All-NCS in 2014 and 2016 and adds the ability to score off the bench for the team.<\/p>\n<p>To assist with its offense, the team has recruited several scoring guards, including first-year Madison Wong. Wong attended Elk Grove High School where she led the team to a state championship and was the all-time career scorer with 13.8 points per game.<\/p>\n<p>The defensive prowess of transfer junior guard Lauren Lete from Foothill College in Los Altos also gives the team an edge outside the post. Lete assisted her team in posting an undefeated season last year.<\/p>\n<p>The team has several notable players on its roster who can make a big impact in the Wildcats success this year. The individual play of the team did not translate to the court last season but may spur more cohesiveness between the returning players and new recruits.<\/p>\n<p><b>Gabriel Moreno can be reached at<\/b> sportseditor@theorion.com or @GabeSports3 on Twitter.\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_59968\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"59968\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A heartbreaking six-game losing streak finished off the Chico State women&#8217;s basketball team last year and left them with a 5-15 conference record.

With football and basketball gaining more attention than golf, the NCAA has reported that it cannot give athletes the same salary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">While the athletes might contribute different amounts to their teams or draw different crowds, the same phenomenon happens in professional sports. Athletes are fairly paid for their efforts, despite varying in skill and performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">Allowing schools to pay their athletes does not take away from the integrity of the organization, but rather supplies athletes with a more achievable path to the professional league.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">With the NCAA making millions on its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncaa.org\/student-athletes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">460,000 athletes<\/a>, the players deserve more than stressful schedules and the possibility of career-ending injuries.
