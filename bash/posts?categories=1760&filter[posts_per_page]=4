Since then, I\u2019ve written and worked on various sections, including opinion, features and arts &amp; entertainment.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been a staff writer, columnist and editor. These three positions taught me the meaning of teamwork and deadlines.<\/p>\n<p>I got to put the skills I learned in my journalism courses to work every time I produced an article.<\/p>\n<p>This opportunity to apply what I learned in the classroom to my future career is something I will always thank the &#8220;O\u201d for.<\/p>\n<p>Also, if I didn\u2019t work for The Orion, I definitely wouldn\u2019t have been as educated about our campus and the Chico community.<\/p>\n<p>One of my favorite semesters on The Orion was working as the arts &amp; entertainment editor in the spring of 2014. As someone who is active in various forms of art, I was ecstatic when given the opportunity to bring the section back to life. When I was editor, the section was only published online. To see it in print today is really rewarding.<\/p>\n<p>My most memorable moment was earning my first Orion mug, which I associate with a Golden Globe. No, I\u2019m not joking. Ever since I learned about the coveted \u201cOrion mug,\u201d I knew from that day forward it was my goal to earn one before graduating. It&#8217;s awarded every Wednesday to the person that goes above and beyond regular expectations.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m thankful to say I\u2019ve earned two in my time here.<\/p>\n<p>I earned my first mug as the arts editor for reviving the arts section, adding more multimedia to my section&#8217;s stories and making the calendar helpful and easy-to-use.<\/p>\n<p>My second mug was awarded this past semester during a week when there was &#8220;lots of good writing.&#8221; My story about a student cancer research scientist was considered the &#8220;best of&#8221; and &#8220;a classic feature story.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_47335\" style=\"width: 651px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-47335\" src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/NicoledanceWEB.jpg\" alt=\"NicoledanceWEB.jpg\" width=\"641\" height=\"369\" data-uniq-id=\"932e5\" srcset=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/NicoledanceWEB.jpg 641w, http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/NicoledanceWEB-475x273.jpg 475w, http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/NicoledanceWEB-300x173.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nicole Santos and her Momentum dance team performed a piece inspired by the group Jabbawockeez.

This gave me the opportunity to not only perform as a hip-hop dancer but to become a choreographer and even sit on the board of directors as secretary.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to choreograph three hip-hop pieces, including a &#8217;90s throwback, an all girls \u201cDivas\u201d number and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Jabbawockeez\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jabbawockeez<\/a>-inspired piece.<\/p>\n<p>This club gave me the opportunity to watch my dance visions come alive each week in rehearsals, working up to actually hitting the stage and performing at our spring and fall showcases at the end of each semester.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_47336\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-47336\" src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/NicoleitalyWEB.jpg\" alt=\"NicoleitalyWEB.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"413\" data-uniq-id=\"537ed\" srcset=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/NicoleitalyWEB.jpg 640w, http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/NicoleitalyWEB-475x307.jpg 475w, http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/NicoleitalyWEB-122x80.jpg 122w, http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/NicoleitalyWEB-300x194.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nicole Santos studied abroad for one semester in Viterbo, Italy, during the first semester of her senior year.

I traveled to various Italian cities taking photos of wondrous gardens and sights one wouldn&#8217;t expect existed. I visited various lakes and oceans. I volunteered as a writer for Viterbo&#8217;s online magazine <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tusciatimes.eu\/?p=47374\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tuscia Times<\/a><\/i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tusciatimes.eu\/?p=47374\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">.<\/a> And all of those experiences came from the courses that I took, not the traveling aspect.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, I was fortunate enough to visit seven countries in the span of the four months I lived in Italy including: Germany, the Czech Republic and France.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s just say the wanderlust is strong with this one.<\/p>\n<p>I knew when I returned home that I was going to need a way to stay connected to the experience, so I inquired about internships in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csuchico.edu\/studyabroad\/index.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Study Abroad office<\/a>. In my last couple of weeks abroad, I participated in my first Skype interview for a possible internship.<\/p>\n<p>This past semester, I\u2019ve worked as both the communications and public relations intern and as a marketing and recruitment intern for the Study Abroad office. It has been the perfect outlet for me to talk about my experience with other alumni and encourage students to go learn in a foreign country.<\/p>\n<p>Studying abroad is truly indescribable, and one day I hope to become a travel writer and photographer documenting<a href=\"http:\/\/nicoleineurope.weebly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> my experiences<\/a> all over the world.<\/p>\n<p>These are three reasons why I\u2019m not ready to leave Chico State, but they have truly set me up for life after graduation.<\/p>\n<p>With my cap and gown resting in my closet, and cords and sashes waiting to be adorned on Saturday, I can happily say that I\u2019m not just saying goodbye to my college town \u2013 I\u2019m saying goodbye to my home.<\/p>\n<p>There are many aspects of Chico that I will miss, including living with Katelyn Pipkin, who has been my roommate since freshman year, and having my best friend, Terry Bunn from back home, attend the same college.<\/p>\n<p>In June, I will begin my paid summer internship with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fresnobee.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Fresno Bee<\/a>, and I wouldn&#8217;t be where I am today if it wasn&#8217;t for the journalism department and all the experiences I gained at Chico.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m so excited for what my future holds as a journalist from this point forward.<\/p>\n<p>I can\u2019t thank Chico State enough for the education I received, the lessons I learned, the accomplishments I achieved and the memories I made with friends who became family.<\/p>\n<p>My advice to current and future Wildcats?<\/p>\n<p>Take advantage of the amazing opportunities Chico State offers for students to get involved. You never know where these opportunities will lead you, and you will meet some of the most inspiring people.<\/p>\n<p>Make Chico State your home.

I thought, well that\u2019s a lot of time and energy that could be put toward doing something good, so I came up with SlideSocial.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>SlideSocial is a mobile app that empowers people to donate in measurable ways to the nonprofit of their choice. All the user has to do is slide through pictures with occasional advertisements.<\/p>\n<p>The SlideSocial formula is as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users post images to the app<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Generates user traffic<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Paid advertising to raise revenue<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue donated to nonprofit partners<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Trees get planted, meals are donated, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Communities and environments are enriched<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The world\u2019s a better place<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As an entrepreneurship major, Palmieri came up with the idea this semester because he wanted to be able to do his own thing and possibly make money while having a positive impact.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the founder and CEO of SlideSocial,\u201d he said. \u201cDr. Colleen Robb is the professor of the social entrepreneurship class I am in, and she also wants to be actively involved in moving forward (with SlideSocial).&#8221;<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_47148\" style=\"width: 710px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-47148\" src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/ChaseeWEB.jpg\" alt=\"ChaseeWEB.jpg\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" data-uniq-id=\"fbb44\" srcset=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/ChaseeWEB.jpg 700w, http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/ChaseeWEB-475x317.jpg 475w, http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/ChaseeWEB-122x80.jpg 122w, http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/ChaseeWEB-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chase Palmieri, founder and CEO of SlideSocial, explains the app platform to an audience at Chico State.

That\u2019s rare these days.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Within his major, it was the people and social values that many of the students and faculty at Chico State possess that helped him prepare for SlideSocial, Palmieri said<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis campus is very focused on sustainability, and that\u2019s something that I care a lot about,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It\u2019s always kind of showed me that you can create a future and a business focused around sustainability. Its first focus is to do good and make money later.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Palmieri\u2019s postgraduation plans are to focus on the app because he\u2019ll have a lot more time to dedicate to the business.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want Chico to be the first campus to adopt the application, and then we are going to want to grow as fast as we can from there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We hope to revolutionize the way people donate.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>Nicole Santos can be reached at<\/b> featureseditor@theorion.com or @Iam_NicoleS on Twitter.\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_47145\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"47145\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Chase Palmieri, creator of SlideSocial, hopes the mobile app will be successful in empowering people to donate in measurable ways.\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_47145\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"47145\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"author":284,"featured_media":47147,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"format":"standard","categories":[1760],"tags":[9433,4908,9458,9430,9452,9457,8330,437,2107,9453,9456,9434,885,9455,7366,9432,9431,9454],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/47145"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/284"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=47145"}],"version-history":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/47145\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/47147"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=47145"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=47145"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=47145"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":46798,"date":"2015-04-29T16:24:11","date_gmt":"2015-04-29T23:24:11","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/?p=46798"},"modified":"2016-02-03T15:27:37","modified_gmt":"2016-02-03T23:27:37","slug":"senior-spotlight-qa-with-nutrition-majors-who-landed-dietetic-internships","type":"post","link":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/46798\/about-us\/archives\/senior-spotlight-qa-with-nutrition-majors-who-landed-dietetic-internships\/","title":{"rendered":"Senior Spotlight: Q&#038;A with nutrition majors who landed internships"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Applying for a dietetic internship is a highly competitive process.

During the course, I followed the dietitian around and was fascinated by her job. I looked more into the career path of becoming a registered dietitian and fell in love. Around the same time of switching my majors, my dad had a mild heart attack. It was difficult, but I went with him to see a dietitian and felt my career choice was solidified. It amazed me how a simple change of diet could have prevented his heart attack, and how his new diet can help prevent future heart problems.<\/p>\n<p><b>Van Buskirk: <\/b>I chose dietetics because I was really interested in how the human body worked.

Photo credit: Nicole Santos<\/p><\/div>\n<p><b>What made you choose to apply to the place where you were accepted?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Albright: <\/b>I applied to places with an emphasis in food service because I have more experience in the food industry, and my long-term career goal is to become a food service manager at a hospital or school district.<\/p>\n<p><b>Van Buskirk: <\/b> A day or two before I submitted my applications, I was comparing internship lists with a friend, and this internship caught my eye because of the rural health emphasis. I grew up in a fairly small town and thought I could relate.<\/p>\n<p><b>What are you most excited for in terms of your placement and the location?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Albright:<\/b> I have actually never left California before so I am extremely excited to experience a new culture. The internship I got accepted to is 86 percent African-American, and it sounds funny, but I am excited to experience being a minority. I grew up in an area that was not very culturally diverse, and I think leaving California is going to be an amazing learning experience for me.<\/p>\n<p><b>Van Buskirk: <\/b>I am really excited for the opportunity to live on the East Coast. My brother and I are going to road trip out there in August and see all the sights along the way. Moving across the country gives me a great reason to travel around the eastern United States.<\/p>\n<p><b>What\u2019s the emphasis of your program and why did you choose that particular one?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Albright: <\/b> School food service management. Considering I am not a competitive applicant in terms of total GPA and internships, I had to focus on what aspects of the field I do have experience in.<\/p>\n<p><b>Van Buskirk: <\/b>It is a rural health emphasis. Since I grew up in a small town that was pretty far from anything \u2014 20 minutes to get groceries or do errands \u2014 I thought that I could relate to the emphasis.<\/p>\n<p><b>What was the most stressful part of the application process?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Albright:<\/b> I think there were two incredibly stressful parts. The first difficult part was going through and deciding which internships to apply to. There are many factors to consider, and it was difficult and time-consuming to narrow down the choices, especially while still focusing on my last semester of college. I think the most stressful part was making sure everything was completed for every internship I was applying for.<\/p>\n<p><b>Van Buskirk: <\/b>After it was all said and done, match day was the most stressful of it all. The way the program works is you pre-rank the internships you want and hopefully those programs rank you. Somehow it filters it all out and on match day, you get one match or no match.
