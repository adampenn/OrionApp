A majority of the negativity stemmed from people highlighting the idea that people are only offended because they&#8217;re overly sensitive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even multiple online news outlets quickly took interest in this campaign launch.

With football and basketball gaining more attention than golf, the NCAA has reported that it cannot give athletes the same salary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">While the athletes might contribute different amounts to their teams or draw different crowds, the same phenomenon happens in professional sports.

The choice of Kaepernick doesn&#8217;t influence the game itself or even rattle the team, it simply provides a silent protest to a recent American tradition.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/dailysnark.com\/nfl-teams-didnt-stand-national-anthem-2009\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Before 2009<\/a>, NFL teams remained in the locker room while the anthem played. A Congressional Report from 2015 showed that t<a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/nfl\/story\/_\/id\/15611052\/nfl-returning-723000-taxpayers-paid-military-tributes\" target=\"_blank\">he Department of Defense paid $5.4 <\/a>million to various NFL teams between 2011 and 2014, in exchange for on-field patriotic ceremonies.<\/p>\n<p>Sitting during a paid patriotic display hardly seems like an Earth-shattering event that should ripple across the NFL, but it has.

The matter extends beyond agreeing with him, as the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcbayarea.com\/news\/local\/Santa-Clara-Police-Officers-Association-May-Boycott-Working-49ers-Games-392214541.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Santa Clara police <\/a>threatened not to protect the 49er&#8217;s home games earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p>The attempt of the league and even the police to turn their backs on the former star only shows a lack of commitment to the safety of their players and citizens.<\/p>\n<p><b>Kenta McAfee can be reached at<\/b> Sportseditor@theorion.com or @KentaMcAfee on Twitter.\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_59431\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"59431\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The NFL had major movements this season, with Twitter now streaming live games and a new $100 million concussion initiative.
