There&#8217;s plenty of treats to go around, but there&#8217;s also a few important tricks to master.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Although Halloween falls on a Monday this year, do not be fooled, the party will go on. Here at Chico State, we are known for dedicating an entire weekend to celebrating Halloween and I expect this year to be no different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Here are five steps to ensure your Chicoween 2016 is one for the books.<\/p>\n<p>1. <b>Get into the spooky spirit<\/b><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important that before Halloween rolls around people get into the holiday spirit. Fall is the perfect time for carving pumpkins and indulging in anything pumpkin spice flavored.<\/p>\n<p>Putting on old Disney Channel movies like &#8220;Hocus Pocus&#8221; and &#8220;Casper the Friendly Ghost&#8221; is a must. It&#8217;s the only time of year people can&#8217;t judge for it, so take advantage.<\/p>\n<p>Makeup wearers can experiment with more dramatic looks or play pranks on roommates.<\/p>\n<p>These things combined are sure to get anyone in the spooky spirit right before the big weekend.<\/p>\n<p>2.<b> Decorate on a budget<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><\/b>Covering front yards in creepy Halloween decorations can be costly.<\/p>\n<p>But it can also be really fun and quite affordable with a little planning. Residents of Chico are lucky enough to live in apartments with patios, houses with front lawns and dorms where at least decorating the doors are allowed.<\/p>\n<p>These are all great locations for throwing on fake spider webs, green goo or a talking skeleton.<\/p>\n<p>On a budget, all these items can be found at places like the 99 Cent Store and The Dollar Tree.<\/p>\n<p>So get together with some friends, set a budget and get to decorating.<\/p>\n<p>3. <b>Planning ahead<\/b><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You may not know exactly whose party you will be attending, but it&#8217;s a good idea to at least know what part of town you will be in and with who.<\/p>\n<p>Plan transportation accordingly as Halloween weekend in Chico is relatively cold. As much fun as walking around in that little mermaid costume, all night might be, having a friend drive can be easier. <b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p>A designated driver is going to be more efficient and comfortable than running across Chico.<\/p>\n<p>The buddy system might seem childish but on a night where people get lost or stranded, it&#8217;s a necessity. Planning out the travel and destinations gives a significantly higher chance of avoiding tragedies.<\/p>\n<p>4. <b>Costumes<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><\/b>Costumes are the biggest part of Halloween.<\/p>\n<p>Originality won&#8217;t be found in a Harley Quinn costume or Donald Trump hair piece, so making a personalized costume can provide much-needed uniqueness to the streets of Chico.<\/p>\n<p>Orienting a costume for the Chico State experience can make a person stand out. Whether it&#8217;s Willie the Wildcat or just the school logo, originality beats the $20 fake hair or short skirt.<\/p>\n<p>5. <b>Get your priorities in order<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><\/b>Chicoween can be a major setback academically for people who choose to party first and study second. Choosing to get ahead before the holiday can give time to rest and recover after the night of partying.<\/p>\n<p>The experience at Chico State might not be complete without celebrating Halloween weekend, but it&#8217;s important to be safe and smart about the decisions that are made.<\/p>\n<p>Trust me, I&#8217;ve been there.<\/p>\n<p><b>Mina Marjanovic can be reached at<\/b> opinioneditor@theorion.com or @marjanovicmina6 on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_59879\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"59879\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Halloween is one of the most celebrated holidays at Chico.

There were pieces written about the drag show, the latinx &amp; LGBTQ+ panel, as well as the pride party. I was ecstatic.<\/p>\n<p>Then, we found the one article that would successfully sour our excitement. While I was elated that queer voices felt celebrated, I was also disappointed to see that coverage tainted by an insensitive, racially prejudiced opinion article. This article claimed that \u201cpoor race relations\u201d are merely a figment of our imagination, unsupported by statistical evidence, since there simply isn\u2019t any \u201cnoticeable racial discrimination\u201d in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>To the author of that article, I am writing to respectfully challenge your piece with hope that you and others will genuinely take the time to reevaluate how y\u2019all stand on this issue. However, I cannot deny that my piece is influenced by anger and frustration. I cannot deny the hurt you&#8217;ve caused many members of our Chico communities of color when you stated things like: \u201cPeople simply have the impression that race problems exist. It\u2019s complete nonsense.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>By no means can I, as a white person, speak for the feelings and experiences of my fellow students of color. In the words of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theplayerstribune.com\/megan-rapinoe-why-i-am-kneeling\/\" target=\"_blank\">Megan Rapinoe<\/a>, who knelt during a soccer game\u2019s national anthem in solidarity with Colin Kaepernik: \u201cI haven\u2019t experienced over-policing, racial profiling, police brutality or the sight of a family member\u2019s body lying dead in the street. But I cannot stand idly by while there are people in this country who have had to deal with that kind of heartache.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the comment I left on your article online, which also respectfully challenged what you wrote, was coincidentally deleted.<\/p>\n<p>As a white person on this campus, I cannot deny the unearned benefits I receive solely due to the color of my skin, just like I cannot deny that my sexuality and gender expression also put me a higher risk of experiencing prejudice, microaggressions, and sometimes violence. Dare I introduce the theory of intersectionality, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/in-theory\/wp\/2015\/09\/24\/why-intersectionality-cant-wait\/?utm_term=.7719f19bb678\" target=\"_blank\">a term coined by law professor and black feminist author Kimberle Crenshaw<\/a>. Understanding and honoring how various types of identities, experiences, and interlocking systems of oppression influence one another is not only a theory but also a way of living, thinking, and feeling.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, here lie the issues with your article.<\/p>\n<p>1. <b>You used the given statistics disingenuously.<\/b> We must adjust for population when discussing the amount of white people killed by police versus black folks or other communities of color. For instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/post-nation\/wp\/2016\/07\/11\/arent-more-white-people-than-black-people-killed-by-police-yes-but-no\/?utm_term=.1603b59b962d\" target=\"_blank\">although we may see similar numbers of unarmed white and black folks being killed by police officers<\/a>, we must also take into consideration that the U.S.\u2019s white population is approximately five times larger than the black population. Do you know what this means? This means that black folks are actually five times more likely to be shot and killed by a police officer. Regardless of the reason(s) behind that statistic, I think it&#8217;s safe to say that folks are validated in feeling a particular way (i.e. confused, angry, scared).<\/p>\n<p>2. <b>You equivocated the experiences of all people of color. <\/b>You failed to see the true diversity in all non-white lived experiences and successfully ignored the current state of our fellow Latinx, Asian\/Pacific Islander, and Native students as well as folks of other ethnicities and cultural backgrounds. Racism affects all of these communities on both a systemic and interpersonal level. Native folks in this country, for instance, have faced (and continue to face) a heinous amount of racism, ranging from their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slate.com\/blogs\/the_vault\/2014\/06\/17\/interactive_map_loss_of_indian_land.html\" target=\"_blank\">lands being seized from the government<\/a> to seeing their culture be made a mockery by professional, amateur, and high school level sports teams (i.e. the Washington Redskins). That unfortunately doesn&#8217;t even begin to scrape the surface.<\/p>\n<p>3. <b>You claimed that races are equally represented in different social areas.<\/b> C\u2019mon, seriously? Other than your citations about our ever-increasing diverse labor force, your \u201cdifferent social areas\u201d are never specified. Why don\u2019t we talk politics, where people in positions of power make significant decisions on our behalf? <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2015\/01\/12\/114th-congress-is-most-diverse-ever\/\" target=\"_blank\">Although non-white folks share roughly 38% of the U.S. population, they only occupy 17% of the seats in Congress.<\/a> Needless to say, Congress is still disproportionately white. And male. And cisgender. And straight. I&#8217;m sensing a trend here.<\/p>\n<p>Why don\u2019t we take this even further and explore the level of representation at our very own university. Although white students do not quantify the majority attending Chico State (at 44%), the reality is not the same for the faculty who teach here. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csuchico.edu\/pa\/chico-facts.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Our instructional faculty are 79.1% white<\/a>; this means that almost four out of five professors you have this year will be white. Although there are efforts taking place to mitigate this and diversify our professors, we can at least acknowledge how this might be affecting our students of color right now. Let\u2019s listen and validate, not cause further pain by ignoring the many truths in the room.<\/p>\n<p>I am not writing to embarrass you, though your piece was embarrassing. I am not writing to shame you, though your piece was shameful. I am writing to speak to a topic that affects many, that cannot simply be captured in some 1000 words or less in a newspaper. It&#8217;s much deeper, much more complex than that.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, I am writing to y\u2019all because if you won\u2019t listen to your fellow students of color, as sad as that is, maybe you\u2019ll listen to another white person. Please reconsider the role you play on our campus. Please ask yourself, in 20 or 30 years, am I going to look back and wish I was on the right side of justice?
