To some college students, that may seem old, but as newspapers go,\u00a0even college newspapers, that\u2019s young. Despite its relative youth, \u201cThe O\u201d finds itself among\u00a0the elite of the nation\u2019s university newspapers. In 2005, The Orion was inducted into the Associated\u00a0Collegiate Press Hall of Fame for its record of achievement. In addition to a mountain of\u00a0other awards, The Orion has won the National Pacemaker award, the most prestigious honor in\u00a0college journalism, 12 times since 1989. In addition, The Orion in 2009 won its second National\u00a0Online Pacemaker.<\/p>\n<p>The Orion is an interesting and successful mix of a journalism course and a student-managed\u00a0newspaper. It functions here at Chico State in an environment, we believe, of unfettered freedom,\u00a0with total student control of content decisions. Still, no operation of its sort can function well\u00a0without rules and regulations. What follows is the newspaper\u2019s staff manual, which, by its very\u00a0nature, is forever a work in progress. The manual includes our mission statement, ethics code,\u00a0libel manual, job descriptions, deadline information, etc. It\u2019s important that all staff members read and understand its\u00a0content, then send an email to the adviser\u00a0affirming that they have.<\/p>\n<p>For some students, the time \u201cin the basement\u201d is their most meaningful Chico State learning experience.\u00a0We hope it is for you, but much will depend on the attitude and work ethic you bring to it.<\/p>\n<p>Have a great semester and feel free to contact us at any time!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/risajohnson2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-48079 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/risajohnson2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Risa Johnson<br \/>\nOrion editor-in-chief<br \/>\neditorinchief@theorion.com<br \/>\nPhone:\u00a0(530) 898-5627<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-33735\" src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/markmug2014.jpg\" alt=\"markmug2014\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Mark Plenke<br \/>\nOrion faculty adviser<br \/>\nOffice: Tehama 345<br \/>\nPhone: (530) 989-4782<br \/>\nCell: (612) 615-5423\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_7161\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"7161\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_7161\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"7161\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"format":"standard","categories":[528],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7161"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7161"}],"version-history":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7161\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7161"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7161"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7161"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":7158,"date":"2014-01-12T15:30:12","date_gmt":"2014-01-12T23:30:12","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/?p=7158"},"modified":"2014-01-12T15:30:12","modified_gmt":"2014-01-12T23:30:12","slug":"mission-statement","type":"post","link":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/7158\/about-us\/stylebook\/mission-statement\/","title":{"rendered":"Mission statement"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>The ability of newspapers to report and to comment on public affairs is based on a unique\u00a0grant of freedom. Our duty is clear: serve our public\u2013the students, faculty and staff of Chico\u00a0State\u2013with skill and character and to exercise First Amendment freedom with vigor and responsibility.<\/p>\n<p>Our goal is to build on a tradition of excellence, as The Orion is recognized as one of the\u00a0finest college newspapers in the country. The newspaper\u2019s purpose is to provide students from\u00a0journalism and other disciplines the opportunity to participate in hands-on, student-managed publishing.<\/p>\n<p>The Orion represents good journalistic taste, embodies a sense of impartiality and fair\u00a0play, and strives for the highest standards of professional conduct.\u00a0The private interests of the staff or of any other group should never influence our news reports.<\/p>\n<p>We must be aggressive in publishing the news. We are relied upon as a source of important\u00a0information by many in the campus community. We compete with other Chico news media for\u00a0stories and for audience. Our motto: \u201cGet it first, but first get it right.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We curry no favors from those in positions of power and prestige. The independence of our\u00a0editors, reporters and photographers is not for sale. No territory of legitimate public interest is\u00a0off limits to fair and competent reporting and commentary.<\/p>\n<p>Our editorials should exhibit strength and courage. They should always been respectful of\u00a0contrary opinion, fair to all sides and should never be tailored to any personal agenda.<\/p>\n<p>Freedom creates the space for excellence. That space must be filled with professional discipline.\u00a0We must never pander to passions nor forget the power of the printed word to hurt the\u00a0innocent and destroy the powerless.<\/p>\n<p>When we make mistakes\u2013and we will\u2013we will correct them promptly and forthrightly. We\u00a0must provide our readers with the space to exercise their free speech, and we must have the courage\u00a0to allow them to do it even when it is personally painful for us. Excellence cannot flourish\u00a0without criticism. Arrogance is poison.<\/p>\n<p>The first priority of The Orion is to present a full, fair and accurate picture of our university\u00a0community. Scandal, conflict and controversy are the core of the news, but they are not all of the\u00a0news. We should be generous in our coverage of achievement; our pages should reflect the grit,\u00a0devotion and diversity of the people of this university.<\/p>\n<p>A great university newspaper is distinguished by the balance, fairness and authority of its reporting\u00a0and editing. Such a newspaper will search as hard for strengths and accomplishments as\u00a0for weakness and failures. Rather than demoralize the university, the great university newspaper\u00a0will inspire the university.\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_7158\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"7158\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_7158\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"7158\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"format":"standard","categories":[528],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7158"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7158"}],"version-history":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7158\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7158"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7158"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7158"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":7155,"date":"2014-01-12T15:28:28","date_gmt":"2014-01-12T23:28:28","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/?p=7155"},"modified":"2015-04-28T14:04:46","modified_gmt":"2015-04-28T21:04:46","slug":"newspaper-operations","type":"post","link":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/7155\/about-us\/stylebook\/newspaper-operations\/","title":{"rendered":"Newspaper operations"},"content":{"rendered":"<h3>General Policy Determinations<\/h3>\n<p>General policy decisions at The Orion are made by editors and\u00a0managers in consultation with the advisers. The editor-in-chief,\u00a0business manager and art director will meet regularly to discuss\u00a0policy issues. Complaints or concerns about policy should be\u00a0addressed to an \u00a0immediate supervisor and, if not adequately\u00a0resolved, taken to one of the three management chiefs. If the\u00a0matter is still not resolved to a staff member\u2019s satisfaction, he or she is encouraged\u00a0to bring the complaint to the adviser.

Section chiefs, editors and managers are selected\u00a0in consultation among the adviser and incumbent managers. Students\u00a0interested in remaining on The Orion for more than one\u00a0semester and filling a position of higher responsibility should contact\u00a0their supervisor and the adviser prior to the end of the semester.\u00a0Each management position requires a letter of application and a statement\u00a0of goals.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>\u00a0Separation of Top Managers<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The process for removing student members of The Orion management team (Big 4, 5, 6, etc.)<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Anyone on the staff and the adviser can initiate a proposal to remove a current manager by writing a letter to the management group in care of the adviser outlining an accusation of illegal or dishonest activity (malfeasance) or failure to perform their job (dereliction). The letter must contain specific examples of behavior harmful to the organization or it will not be forwarded for action.<\/li>\n<li>If the letter meeting the criteria for removal, the adviser will present physical copies of the letter to the management group at its regular weekly meeting. The person making the allegations need not be identified at this stage.<\/li>\n<li>If the manager accused of malfeasance or dereliction admits to the allegations, he or she will be dismissed from the paper immediately and will be paid on a pro-rata basis for days worked in that month. He or she will clean out their desk and return any keys or other Orion property to the adviser immediately.<\/li>\n<li>If the accused manager disputes the accusations, the three remaining students in the management group will schedule a time to take testimony from the accuser and the accused, who may ask witness to appear.<\/li>\n<li>Because this is a personnel matter, only members of the management group may attend the hearing. Witnesses may attend only for the time they are testifying.<\/li>\n<li>The three students must come to a unanimous decision about dismissing or retaining the accused manager delivered in writing to the adviser and the manager. If the person is to be dismissed, he or she will be terminated immediately, will be paid on a pro-rata basis for days worked that month, clean out his or her desk and return any keys or other Orion property to the adviser.<\/li>\n<li>There will be no appeals to the decision.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Cleanliness and professionalism<\/h3>\n<p>Staff members should:<br \/>\n\u2022 Keep their work areas clean<br \/>\n\u2022 Answer phones promptly and in a professional manner.<br \/>\n\u2022 Greet visitors to the office in a professional way<br \/>\n\u2022 Treat fellow staff members with respect<br \/>\n\u2022 Behave professionally while representing the paper in public<\/p>\n<p>They should not:<br \/>\n\u2022 Eat or drink near the computers<br \/>\n\u2022 Smoke in any university buildings<br \/>\nThe ban on smoking,\u00a0drinking and eating near the computers must be enforced\u00a0by student editors.<\/p>\n<h3>Personal items<\/h3>\n<p>The Orion does not ensure the security of personal property,\u00a0such as textbooks, library books, stereos, purses, book bags, or\u00a0other personal belongings.<\/p>\n<h3>Security and safety<\/h3>\n<p>Staff members:<br \/>\n\u2022 are discouraged from working\u00a0in the offices after midnight, even on production nights.<br \/>\n\u2022 should not leave the\u00a0offices unescorted at night or on weekends or\u00a0holidays.
