I was given a second chance to extend my athletic career by playing club sports. <\/p>\n<p>When I signed up for women&#8217;s rugby, I didn&#8217;t understand the stresses and demands that came with being a student-athlete for a club sport.<\/p>\n<p>There isn&#8217;t paid tuition or excused absences, or even free uniforms when playing club sports. A trainer doesn&#8217;t wait on the sidelines after practices, and there is no designated pregame warmup led by kinesiology experts to prevent injuries.<\/p>\n<p>All student-athletes face the pressures of staying up late doing homework and waking up early the next morning for conditioning regardless of if they are through the school or other organization. But for student-athletes outside of the school&#8217;s athletic program, it is a paid membership with stricter rules.<\/p>\n<p>Chico State does not accept club sports as an excuse for missing class, even though the teams are required to travel a majority of the time to find tournaments and competitions to compete in. The student-athletes are also expected to fundraise to supply the vehicles and lodging for their tournaments.<\/p>\n<p>UC Davis student and cornerback, Jabari Howard, compared the differences between student-athletes and regular students in his article <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/uloop\/the-life-of-a-student-ath_b_2963409.html\">&#8220;The life of a student-athlete.&#8221;<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Howard shows that athletes playing for a school organization are treated exceptionally well and are given more opportunities. For club athletes, these possibilities do not exist. <\/p>\n<p>Regardless of the success of a club sport, it is not generally recognized by the school or given attention. The women&#8217;s rugby team was able to travel to North Carolina for the National competition last season despite being self-funded.<\/p>\n<p>Although club sports miss the title of being school affiliated, its accomplishments and dedication cannot be overlooked. The struggle of student-athletes to succeed in school, attend their practice and continue paying monthly dues falls on deaf ears because of the club title.<\/p>\n<p>Athletes don&#8217;t compete just for the recognition. The cheers of fans and the accomplishments of the team as a whole are great motivating factors, but it is the love of the game that pushes club athletes to their limits and acts as the true catalyst for the players. <\/p>\n<p><b>Makayla Hopkins can be reached at<\/b> sportseditor@theorion.com or @_MakaylaHopkins on Twitter.<\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_59737\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"59737\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The life of a student-athlete is glamorous and fulfilling until it involves club sports.

The lack of supplemental income results in several athletes not only focusing on their sport and schoolwork but a job as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">Athletes at Chico State are not given free housing, and most do not have their tuition paid for.

The league made <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncaa.org\/about\/resources\/finances\/revenue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$6 billion<\/a> on their college athletes last year, despite the athletes being alone on the field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">College is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/college-sports\/story\/_\/id\/8236949\/ncaa-increases-minimum-eligibility-standards-division-student-athletes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">requirement for athletes<\/a> who are considering going pro, but rather than improve their skills on the field, and gain an education, athletes are forced to struggle through the experience to make it to next level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">The idea of college athletes enduring the four-year grind to reach the pros is not an acceptable standard anymore, with only about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncaa.org\/about\/resources\/research\/estimated-probability-competing-professional-athletics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">two percent<\/a> making it past the collegiate level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">The revenue the student-athletes are generating each game is not reflected by ramen noodle dinners and pint-sized dorms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">The NCAA has addressed the issue of paying their college athletes, as there is no standard rate across sports, or even among athletes. With football and basketball gaining more attention than golf, the NCAA has reported that it cannot give athletes the same salary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">While the athletes might contribute different amounts to their teams or draw different crowds, the same phenomenon happens in professional sports. Athletes are fairly paid for their efforts, despite varying in skill and performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">Allowing schools to pay their athletes does not take away from the integrity of the organization, but rather supplies athletes with a more achievable path to the professional league.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">With the NCAA making millions on its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncaa.org\/student-athletes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">460,000 athletes<\/a>, the players deserve more than stressful schedules and the possibility of career-ending injuries.
