Long lines, out-of-stock items and disastrous sales floors can be a turnoff, but knowing how to tackle holiday shopping the right way can eliminate the stress that is often unavoidable when trying to find the perfect gift for your mother-in-law. <\/p>\n<p>Keep these shopping tips in mind to save time, energy and money:<\/p>\n<p><b>Mobile applications<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Believe it or not, there are free apps out there that can actually help you save money while you shop. Keep this in mind before you knock out your holiday shopping list and do some research for your favorite stores. <b><br \/><\/b><\/p>\n<p>Shopkick gives you points for simply walking into select stores. The points you rack up are applied to a reward, usually a gift card, of your choice. You can also earn points by scanning featured items on your phone or making select purchases. Not only can you trade in your points for a gift card, some stores even offer coupons through the app. For example, Best Buy not only gives you 100 points&#8212; good enough to receive American Eagle rewards&#8212; just for walking in the store, it also offers 25 percent off select TVs. <\/p>\n<p>Cartwheel by Target gives shoppers a discount at checkout in the form of a mobile coupon. Shoppers can scan their items as they shop to find coupons for up to 50 percent off. Coupons are added to a mobile &#8220;cart&#8221; and generated into a coupon that can save you hundreds of dollars (if you shop right). <\/p>\n<p><b>Retail employees<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Navigating stores during the holidays can be stressful. Finding a good parking spot can tack on 20 minutes to your shopping trip, carts will be scarce and the checkout line could weave through aisles all the way to the back of the store. <b><br \/><\/b><\/p>\n<p>But don&#8217;t forget about the little worker bees who are bending over backward to make your shopping experience a little easier. Most employees are new hires to help with the craziness of holiday shoppers, so keep in mind that they may be just as overwhelmed or frustrated as you. However, employees are trained to make customers happy at all costs, whether it be fetching you the very last Adele CD from the top shelf in the stockroom or honoring the $20 sign you believed to be sitting in front of the $40 electric blanket (so try to stay on their good side). <\/p>\n<p>And remember that you&#8217;re not the only one shopping. A lot of things are going to be out of stock and stores have limited shelf space for seasonal items. Utilize online shopping (most stores offer free shipping this time of year) for a larger selection.<\/p>\n<p><b>Best times to shop<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Most stores are crowded from 10 a.m. through 8 p.m. Luckily for you, extended holiday hours are a thing (but don&#8217;t be that person who buys everything on Christmas eve). Your best bet is to get your holiday shopping done in the early morning when the store opens or after 10 p.m.<b><br \/><\/b><\/p>\n<p>If store hours still don&#8217;t work with your schedule, call ahead to put items on hold or check what&#8217;s in stock. The best time to call is first thing in the morning when the store is fully stocked and shelves have yet to be touched by customers. But don;t forget about your holds&#8212; most stores will only keep them tucked away until the end of the day to satisfy other shoppers. <\/p>\n<p>Spread the holiday cheer and keep these tips in mind before you embark on your shopping excursion. Save your money with the convenience of hand-held technology, save your gas by shopping online or calling ahead and, most importantly, save your breath before arguing with the retail employees who are probably more miserable than you. <\/p>\n<p><b>Haley Rodriguez can be reached at<\/b> chiefcopyeditor@theorion.com or @HaleyRod_ on Twitter. <\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_50998\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"50998\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As you battle the long lines of the holiday season, here are a few tips to make your shopping experience that much more easier.\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_50998\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"50998\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"author":284,"featured_media":51000,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"format":"standard","categories":[100],"tags":[6949,10964,6571,10966,10962,9434,10965,10961,10963,3926],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/50998"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/284"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=50998"}],"version-history":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/50998\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/51000"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=50998"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=50998"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=50998"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":50930,"date":"2015-12-07T22:30:00","date_gmt":"2015-12-08T06:30:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/?p=50930"},"modified":"2015-12-07T22:15:46","modified_gmt":"2015-12-08T06:15:46","slug":"diy-presents-for-family-and-friends","type":"post","link":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/50930\/multimedia\/special-sections\/diy-presents-for-family-and-friends\/","title":{"rendered":"DIY presents for family and friends"},"content":{"rendered":"<div id=\"attachment_50932\" style=\"width: 698px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/GiftsFriends.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-50932\"><img alt=\"GiftsFriends.jpg\" src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/GiftsFriends-688x900.jpg\" data-uniq-id=\"00187\" width=\"688\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50932\" srcset=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/GiftsFriends-688x900.jpg 688w, http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/GiftsFriends-363x475.jpg 363w, http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/GiftsFriends.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Illustration by Kayce Tynan Photo credit: Kayce Tynan<\/p><\/div>\n<p>&#8216;Tis the season to bear gifts to family and friends. I&#8217;m guessing a lot of us do not have loads of money to spend, since you know, we&#8217;re in college.<\/p>\n<p>Have no fear because I came up with two do-it-yourself gifts that are sure to please: sugar scrubs and a classic snow globe.<\/p>\n<p>For the sugar scrub you will need: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 drop of green food coloring<\/li>\n<li>1 1\/2 cups of sugar<\/li>\n<li>1 tbsp. of peppermint extract <\/li>\n<li>1\/2 cup of coconut oil<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Along with this, you might want to have a jar or something to put the completed sugar scrub in and a pretty ribbon to garnish the final product.<\/p>\n<p>1. Start by microwaving the coconut oil on high for 15 to 20 seconds to get it warm. <\/p>\n<p>2. Add in the sugar, green food coloring and peppermint extract. <\/p>\n<p>3. Mix the ingredients until the coloring is evenly spread. If the mixture is too wet, add more sugar. <\/p>\n<p>4. Finally, put the scrub into your container and your first DIY present is complete.<\/p>\n<p>The next gift is a snow globe. Remember those? It was always so fun to watch the snow fall around the object in the middle. <\/p>\n<p>For the snow globe you will need:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mason jar<\/li>\n<li>Glitter or fake snow<\/li>\n<li>Glycerin (makes the snow or glitter fall slower and can be found at CVS or Amazon)<\/li>\n<li>Figurine for the center<\/li>\n<li>Hot glue gun<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>1.

Add in the fake snow or glitter. <\/p>\n<p>4. Carefully place the lid on the mason jar. Glue the lid to the mason jar, checking for any leaks. You now have a completed mason jar.<\/p>\n<p>Wrap these gifts and give them out to family and friends.

This can only mean one thing: the holiday season is approaching.<\/p>\n<p>Spreading holiday cheer can be a bit tough when you don&#8217;t know what to do. Living in Chico for school is great, but finding stuff to do around the holidays can be tricky if you don&#8217;t know what to look for. Luckily, this handy guide can give you and your friends some ideas to create a memorable holiday season.<\/p>\n<p>The beginning of December starts off the holiday season with Downtown Chico&#8217;s <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.downtownchico.com\/event-hometown-holiday-hospitality_50.htm\">Hometown Holiday Hospitality<\/a>. This is a series of events that starts off with Shop, Dine and Save Fridays. The downtown event includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free parking<\/li>\n<li>Open-late shops and restaurants<\/li>\n<li>Free buttons and candy from greeters<\/li>\n<li>Entertainment held inside and outside of stores<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The remaining Shop, Dine and Save Friday events will take place on Dec. 11 and 18. This is the perfect time to shop for various loved ones and give back to local businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Along with these Friday events, Chico Performances will put on shows throughout the month of December. Among these events is a classic that is sure to please parents&#8212; Handel&#8217;s Messiah. This choir performance will be held on Dec. 20. Tickets can be purchased online at the Chico Performances<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.csuchico.edu\/upe\/performance\/\"> website<\/a> or at the University Box Office on the corner of West Third and Chestnut streets. Hours of operation are from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday.<\/p>\n<p>The holiday season is a time to spend hard-earned money on gifts to give to friends and family. Although this is true, it is also a time to take a step back and enjoy all that you do have. Spend time with loved ones  and make those memories that will last a lifetime. <\/p>\n<p><b>Madeline Merlic can be reached at <\/b>lindsaypincus.theorion@gmail.com or on Twitter @MMerlic.<\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_50894\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"50894\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Get out and make the most of this holiday season with these merry events.\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_50894\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"50894\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"author":284,"featured_media":50896,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"format":"standard","categories":[100],"tags":[7442,571],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/50894"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/284"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=50894"}],"version-history":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/50894\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/50896"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=50894"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=50894"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=50894"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
