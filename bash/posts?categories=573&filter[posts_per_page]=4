The lack of supplemental income results in several athletes not only focusing on their sport and schoolwork but a job as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">Athletes at Chico State are not given free housing, and most do not have their tuition paid for. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/college-football\/story\/_\/id\/13455477\/nlrb-says-northwestern-players-cannot-unionize\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lack of benefits<\/a> given to the athletes at Division II schools shows the ways that universities are able to make money on the talent of their players.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">It\u2019s not just a problem that affects the 300 athletes at Chico State, it\u2019s across the NCAA. The NCAA has no specific ruling against paying athletes but has been active in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2015\/05\/05\/ncaa-pay-players-student-athletes_n_7207860.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">advocating against the idea<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">The Division I schools under the NCAA are allowed to give their athletes full-ride scholarships but are not given other forms of income. The benefits <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncaa.org\/student-athletes\/future\/scholarships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">diminish<\/a> as athletes participate in lesser leagues, with Division II athletes only being offered a fraction of their tuition cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">The problem that the NCAA fails to address is that college athletes aren\u2019t a big ticket item for the league to exploit. The league made <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncaa.org\/about\/resources\/finances\/revenue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$6 billion<\/a> on their college athletes last year, despite the athletes being alone on the field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">College is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/college-sports\/story\/_\/id\/8236949\/ncaa-increases-minimum-eligibility-standards-division-student-athletes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">requirement for athletes<\/a> who are considering going pro, but rather than improve their skills on the field, and gain an education, athletes are forced to struggle through the experience to make it to next level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">The idea of college athletes enduring the four-year grind to reach the pros is not an acceptable standard anymore, with only about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncaa.org\/about\/resources\/research\/estimated-probability-competing-professional-athletics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">two percent<\/a> making it past the collegiate level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">The revenue the student-athletes are generating each game is not reflected by ramen noodle dinners and pint-sized dorms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">The NCAA has addressed the issue of paying their college athletes, as there is no standard rate across sports, or even among athletes. With football and basketball gaining more attention than golf, the NCAA has reported that it cannot give athletes the same salary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">While the athletes might contribute different amounts to their teams or draw different crowds, the same phenomenon happens in professional sports. Athletes are fairly paid for their efforts, despite varying in skill and performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">Allowing schools to pay their athletes does not take away from the integrity of the organization, but rather supplies athletes with a more achievable path to the professional league.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">With the NCAA making millions on its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncaa.org\/student-athletes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">460,000 athletes<\/a>, the players deserve more than stressful schedules and the possibility of career-ending injuries. Athletes should not be forced to endure more during their college experience in an endeavor to continue playing their sports.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s4\"><b>Kenta McAfee can be reached at<\/b><i> <\/i><\/span>sportseditor@theorion.com or @KentaMcAfee on Twitter.\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_59734\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"59734\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The only difference between college athletes and high school athletes is the workload.

As a first-year she set a new Chico State single-season record for home runs for someone in their first season. As a junior in 2015, Gonzalez led the Wildcats in home runs (7), extra-base hits (22) and slugging percentage (.607), earning All-CCAA Honorable Mention.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As a freshman I didn&#8217;t say a single word on the field. Now as a senior I feel I have become a sort of leader for the team,&#8221; Gonzalez said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s very mom-like,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;She has taken a lot of the girls under her wing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Over the time that Gonzalez has played for Chico State she has come across different groups of girls. This group she says however, is especially unique.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This group is very special. They have the heart and desire to do something big for Chico State softball.

However for one senior, Brooke Langeloh, this won&#8217;t be how her career ends.<\/p>\n<p> After her graduation ceremony on May 21, she is heading straight for Sweden to play softball and coach some young up-and-coming players. <\/p>\n<p>When the opportunity presented itself to Langeloh, there was no question whether she wanted to go. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My old pitching coach moved over there to coach and then contacted the Chico State coach asking if any of the players wanted this opportunity,&#8221; Langeloh said. &#8220;Because I knew the coach in Sweden I thought, why not?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Getting to be in Sweden for five months isn&#8217;t the only perk that this job has. It also includes flight and living cost along with payment for being a coach. Langeloh will specifically be working with girls around 14 years old, although the league has a wide range of ages from 12 to 30-year-old women. <\/p>\n<p>Langeloh has always wanted to travel so she knows that this is her chance. With practices on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, it allows her some free time to explore Sweden and the surrounding countries. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The schedule is already set so I can kind of plan around it. The only problem is the calendar is in Swedish so I don&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; Langeloh said. &#8220;I do know that there will be a tournament in Italy. They qualified for it last year so they hopefully will again, so that is really exciting.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>Moving to another country can be challenging enough if you speak the language, but for Langeloh it will be a little more challenging because she doesn&#8217;t speak very much Swedish.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In high school we had a foreign exchange student from Sweden that I have stayed in contact with. When I decided to go, I started talking to her more about the language and anything I really should know, because many of them do speak English,&#8221; Langeloh said. <\/p>\n<p>Of course moving across the world for five months when you have never been out of the country could be extremely scary, but she isn&#8217;t too worried mainly because her sister is traveling with her. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My only real worry is flying to be honest. I really don&#8217;t enjoy it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My other worry is just being careful over in Europe. With everything else that has been going on it is a little scary to be living in the middle of it. My mom told me just to be super careful and make wise decisions.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>Even with the fear of flying she is more excited than anything else. Langeloh said she loves meeting new people and experiencing new places, so she is going to make this trip the best she&#8217;s ever been on. <\/p>\n<p><b>Esther Briggs can be contacted at <\/b>orionsportseditor@gmail.com or @EstherBriggs191 on Twitter.<\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_56776\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"56776\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Senior pitcher Brooke Langeloh continues her love for softball overseas.\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_56776\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"56776\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"author":3,"featured_media":56778,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"format":"standard","categories":[573,13],"tags":[2895,54,12112,12740,10192,6579],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/56776"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=56776"}],"version-history":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/56776\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/56778"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=56776"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=56776"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=56776"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
