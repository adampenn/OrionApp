The lack of supplemental income results in several athletes not only focusing on their sport and schoolwork but a job as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">Athletes at Chico State are not given free housing, and most do not have their tuition paid for. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/college-football\/story\/_\/id\/13455477\/nlrb-says-northwestern-players-cannot-unionize\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lack of benefits<\/a> given to the athletes at Division II schools shows the ways that universities are able to make money on the talent of their players.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">It\u2019s not just a problem that affects the 300 athletes at Chico State, it\u2019s across the NCAA. The NCAA has no specific ruling against paying athletes but has been active in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2015\/05\/05\/ncaa-pay-players-student-athletes_n_7207860.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">advocating against the idea<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">The Division I schools under the NCAA are allowed to give their athletes full-ride scholarships but are not given other forms of income. The benefits <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncaa.org\/student-athletes\/future\/scholarships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">diminish<\/a> as athletes participate in lesser leagues, with Division II athletes only being offered a fraction of their tuition cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">The problem that the NCAA fails to address is that college athletes aren\u2019t a big ticket item for the league to exploit. The league made <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncaa.org\/about\/resources\/finances\/revenue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$6 billion<\/a> on their college athletes last year, despite the athletes being alone on the field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">College is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/college-sports\/story\/_\/id\/8236949\/ncaa-increases-minimum-eligibility-standards-division-student-athletes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">requirement for athletes<\/a> who are considering going pro, but rather than improve their skills on the field, and gain an education, athletes are forced to struggle through the experience to make it to next level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">The idea of college athletes enduring the four-year grind to reach the pros is not an acceptable standard anymore, with only about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncaa.org\/about\/resources\/research\/estimated-probability-competing-professional-athletics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">two percent<\/a> making it past the collegiate level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">The revenue the student-athletes are generating each game is not reflected by ramen noodle dinners and pint-sized dorms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">The NCAA has addressed the issue of paying their college athletes, as there is no standard rate across sports, or even among athletes. With football and basketball gaining more attention than golf, the NCAA has reported that it cannot give athletes the same salary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">While the athletes might contribute different amounts to their teams or draw different crowds, the same phenomenon happens in professional sports. Athletes are fairly paid for their efforts, despite varying in skill and performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">Allowing schools to pay their athletes does not take away from the integrity of the organization, but rather supplies athletes with a more achievable path to the professional league.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\">With the NCAA making millions on its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncaa.org\/student-athletes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">460,000 athletes<\/a>, the players deserve more than stressful schedules and the possibility of career-ending injuries. Athletes should not be forced to endure more during their college experience in an endeavor to continue playing their sports.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s4\"><b>Kenta McAfee can be reached at<\/b><i> <\/i><\/span>sportseditor@theorion.com or @KentaMcAfee on Twitter.\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_59734\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"59734\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The only difference between college athletes and high school athletes is the workload.

After three failed attempts and some time in jail, he and his family made it to Mexico in 2008.<\/p>\n<p>Palmer was born in a working-class steel mill town in west Pennsylvania in 1929. He attended Wake Forest College on a golf scholarship, just a stepping stone on his way to becoming one of the best golfers the world has ever seen.<\/p>\n<p>On Sunday, Sept. 25, the two tragically shared the same spotlight.<\/p>\n<p>Fernandez was just 24 when the boat he was on crashed, killing him and two other passengers early that morning. Palmer, 87, died in a hospital in his home state while awaiting cardiac surgery later that day. <\/p>\n<p>Palmer left behind a lifetime of achievements and unforgettable memories. He won the Masters four times, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Honor and is the famed creator of the half ice tea, half lemonade drink, naturally named an &#8220;Arnold Palmer.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Fernandez&#8217;s story was just getting started. In 2013, he won Rookie of the Year and was voted to the All-Star game. In 2014, Tommy John surgery forced him to miss most of the season. After recovering from surgery, he dominated the league once again with his electrifying fastball, appearing in his second All-Star game this past July.<\/p>\n<p>Palmer will be remembered for a legacy that will never be matched. Fernandez will be remembered for a legacy that never got the chance to come to fruition.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s times like these when sports transcend a ball or a golf club.

Teams all over Major League Baseball hung &#8220;Fernandez&#8221; jerseys in their dugouts at the games following his death. <\/p>\n<p>The Marlins&#8217; first game back following Fernandez&#8217;s death seemed like a movie script. Minutes after honoring his teammate in the opening ceremony, shortstop Dee Gordon hit his first home run of the season. As he rounded the bases, tears rushed down his face, along with the fans and opposing players. You don&#8217;t even have to be a sports fan for that moment to send chills down your back. <\/p>\n<p>Sports can triumph over any racial or economic differences. They don&#8217;t care who you are or where you come from. The golfer that lives on a country club golf course was affected by the death of Palmer the same way a kid in Cuba playing baseball with a rock and wooden stick was affected by Fernandez. Two different worlds, same grieving fans. <\/p>\n<p>As everyone tries to move on from the loss of a legend and a star taken too soon, they are reminded that they&#8217;re not alone, just like Palmer and Fernandez. <\/p>\n<p>Though they may come from two very different backgrounds, the two will be remembered together on September 25. <\/p>\n<p><b>Nick Martinez-Esquibel can be reached at<\/b> sportseditor@theorion.com or @THENickMartinez on Twitter.<\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_58691\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"58691\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Golf legend Arnold Palmer and Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez came from two very different backgrounds.

Lecce threw in five total wins on the season, including two consecutive wins against Cal State Los Angeles.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Being a senior on this team means I have the responsibility of being a leader on and off the field,&#8221; Lecce said. &#8220;To be the best teammate possible and to enjoy every second since it&#8217;ll be my last.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>AJ Epstein, a pitcher from Barstow Community College, appeared in 22 games on the season and finished with two wins and two saves.  In 40.2 innings pitched, he had a consistent ERA of 3.98.
