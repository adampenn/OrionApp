Listen intently and you may hear these words spoken in the distance. Maybe yelled, maybe whispered. Either way, this phrase heard \u2018round the web is a reference to the series of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.snapchat.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Snapchat<\/a> videos that\u2019s releasing its rage onto the internet.<\/p>\n<p>The short clips were composed into one <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hRzjJziFR5o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">video<\/a>, which <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Josholzz?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Josh Olzz<\/a> uploaded to his Twitter on Feb. 15. It has already racked up hundreds of thousands of retweets.<\/p>\n<p>The actual Daniel from the video is <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/daniel_laraa?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daniel Lara<\/a>, a high school student in Riverside, California. His Twitter now has upward of 300,000 followers.<\/p>\n<p>On Sunday, Feb. 21, \u201cDaniel\u201d was trending with over one million tweets.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe you don\u2019t get it. Maybe you don\u2019t even think the voice is funny. Either way, you know about it. The more retweets the video gets, the more people see it. It just grows and grows.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter<\/a> is the main platform that it spread through. It can also be found on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Instagram,<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tumblr<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">F<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">acebook<\/a>. It even transcends social media, sent through email and text.<\/p>\n<p>Social media videos offer such entertaining, yet compressed content. They\u2019re quick to view and easy to get lost in. We love to soak up mass amounts of information and this content propels this need.<\/p>\n<p>Not only is it impossible to navigate social media without seeing this, it\u2019s difficult to avoid it in real life.<\/p>\n<p>Stores that sell white Vans are subject to selling <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vans.com\/shop\/mens-womens-white-footwear\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Damn Daniels<\/a>. Anybody named Daniel is in for a month of harassment. And most certainly, do not wear a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stussy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stussy<\/a> shirt.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/bombs-away\/damn-daniel-remix-free-download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Songs<\/a> remixing the audio have been uploaded to <a href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">SoundCloud<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There are countless attempts of people trying to reenact the video.

When a tweet is sent out and gains popularity in real time, we\u2019re forced to discuss it. We share it on our social media platforms and in person.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s the new water cooler culture. Let\u2019s call it Sutter Dining Hall culture: to meet up with friends and discuss the tweets from the night before.<\/p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t seen the video, it\u2019s surprising. Even if you\u2019re not on the platform, it\u2019s all around you. You either participate by watching the video or are forced to feel left out.<\/p>\n<p>Just as people would bond over a television show, people bond over social media posts because they\u2019re happening in real time. People don\u2019t sit down to watch an episode of &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0063878\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Brady Bunch<\/a>&#8221; together, they huddle around their phones to watch vines and make sure their <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/sg\/app\/kendall-and-kylie\/id1032381310?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kendall and Kylie<\/a> avatar is still alive.<\/p>\n<p>Videos like this are always subject to face contrarians, which polarize the feed. In a sense, this is good for the popularity of the video. It\u2019s like, as much as you want to ignore <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biography.com\/people\/donald-trump-9511238\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Donald Trump<\/a>, you can\u2019t help but eventually voice your opinion. Instead of ignoring it, you contribute to the trend, bringing awareness to it. You anger those that like it and associate with those that don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>Is this simply their 15 minutes of fame, or are they here to stay like many popular social media users?<\/p>\n<p>Social media is no longer used to just share with our friends and family. We\u2019re marketing ourselves to others.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter users can reach a large crowd once they reach popularity and profit. The <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Expherience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Expherience<\/a>, for example, is a psychedelic Twitter account that started to <a href=\"http:\/\/expherience.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sell clothing<\/a> once it gained popularity. Twitter user <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Zilliamson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zach Williamson<\/a> created multiple Twitter accounts that gained numerous followers. He used his posts as advertising space and then sold the accounts.<\/p>\n<p>Social media celebrities are the new movie stars. As long as they keep updating their platforms, they\u2019ll maintain relevancy.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s up to Daniel and Josh how they\u2019ll use their new-found fame. Or whether it will even last.<\/p>\n<p>Them aside, this shows how much of a catapult social media can be into the mainstream. Whether you like it or not, it\u2019s going to continue to have a huge impact on your life.<\/p>\n<p><b>Sam Rios can be reached at<\/b> orionopinioneditor@gmail.com or @theeemessiahon Twitter.\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n<p id=\"pvc_stats_53756\" class=\"pvc_stats \" element-id=\"53756\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theorion.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/page-views-count\/ajax-loader.gif\" border=0 \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"pvc_clear\"><\/div>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Damn Daniel!

Sources and social network information has confirmed that this weekend was not all dedicated to academia.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, students have found their timelines flooded with filtered pictures of young Greek-life Chico residents dressed up and posing for what can most accurately be described as Adult Prom.<\/p>\n<p>Sources say that these fraternities and sororities call the events &#8220;formals,&#8221; or events dedicated to showcasing each individual\u2019s inherent privilege to their peers.<\/p>\n<p>Chico State &#8220;students [sic],&#8221; prepared for the night by contacting other Greeks and asking them to go with one another as dates.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It keeps everything within the Greek community,&#8221; said Chris Hartman, president of Delta Upsilon Iota, an unaccredited and non-academic fraternity on Ivy Street. &#8220;That way we don&#8217;t ever have to talk to or be seen with anyone unlike ourselves.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Many Greeks stressed the necessity, importance and functionality of the gatherings.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t do spring formals,&#8221; Jessica Johnson said. \u201cThen how are we supposed to have pictures of us in dresses and suits for our Instagram&#8217;s?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Others, like Derrick O&#8217;Brien of Delta Iota Chi, feel the bi-annual festivities are actually too infrequent.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I honestly want to have more formals,&#8221;
